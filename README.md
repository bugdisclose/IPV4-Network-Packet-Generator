# IPV4-Network-Packet-Generator
A packet generator or packet builder is a type of software
that generates random packets or allows the user to
construct detailed custom packets. Depending on the
network medium and operating system, packet generators
utilize raw sockets, NDIS function calls, or direct access to
the network adapter kernel-mode driver.
This is useful for testing implementations of IP stacks
for bugs and security vulnerabilities.
The objective of this project is to design and develop a
network packet generator that supports basic features such
as sending a packet continuous or non-continuous, any
protocol such as UDP, TCP, ICMP ,and of respective
packet length and payload option could be user-defined or
random using any source port and destination port by using
ip addresses.
Currently there no packet generators that offer low cost
and high performance.The goal is to offer a simple, low
cost, and high performance packet generator that can meet
the basic testing needs of network industry.
